# DataProxy Pattern for Delphi

## Overview

TDataSetProxy is a wrapper component for the TDataSet component. It allows to replace a data set component with a mock - memory table. Solution can be used to separate a business class from used by this class datasets during unit testing.

**Inspiration**. Idea is based on Proxy GoF Pattern and Table Module Pattern (from: Martin Fowler - Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture).
